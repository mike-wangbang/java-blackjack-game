# Java Blackjack Game

## u2s5d's CPSC 210 Project

This project is a simplified version of the popular casino game *Blackjack*. The premise of the game involves
placing a bet and drawing cards to reach a total value of 21. As the rules of *Blackjack* are fairly simple,
anyone is able to play this version of the game, and there will not be any real money used. This project interests
me because I have always been fascinated by the logic and probability found in casino games, so I wanted to 
design an implementation of one game in Java. I already know how to play *Blackjack*, so I think I will have fun
working on this project.
